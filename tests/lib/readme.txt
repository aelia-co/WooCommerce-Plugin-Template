Put unit test classes in this folder. For consistency, you can organise the test class files using the same folder structure used for the /src folder. Each test file should have the same name of the class file being tested, with a "-test.php" suffix. For example, if you are implementing the tests fore a class saved in "some-class-file.php", you should call the test file "some-class-file-test.php". PHPUnit will then be able to load them automatically.
